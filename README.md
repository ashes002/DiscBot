# Overview

Alpaca Roleplay Discordbot is a software project for running the Alpaca (or LLaMa) Large Language Model as a roleplaying discord bot. The bot is designed to run locally on a PC with as little as 8GB of VRAM. The bot listens for messages mentioning its username, replying to it's messages, or any DM's it receives, processes the message content, and generates a response based on the input.

REQUIRED: NVIDIA GPU with at least 12GB of VRAM for 7B model, and 24GB of VRAM for 13B models

I'm now recommending the use of Alpaca-Native Finetune on 7B model, requiring only 12GB vram: [https://huggingface.co/chavinlo/alpaca-native](https://huggingface.co/chavinlo/alpaca-native)
